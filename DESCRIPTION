Description: Implements the UBRA-2D v2-A.2 framework for decomposing Mendelian
    randomization effects into latent genetic risk factors using mixture
    regression, stability selection, and tail-risk metrics (VaR/CVaR).
    The package is designed for robust genetic risk stratification beyond
    traditional all-SNP Mendelian randomization.
